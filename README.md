This project demonstrates how to identify the nearest facilities for given incident site / location using ArcMap 10.8 and Python scripting. Initially, Excel files containing location data for facilities and incidents were converted into shapefiles. The road network dataset was sourced from the NYS GIS Clearinghouse , and all layers were geocoded and projected to the NAD 1983 NYUTM 18N coordinate system to maintain layers consistency. After processing a network dataset was built using the road shapefile.From there, the process of solving the Closest Facility problem was automated using an ArcPy script. The script creates a Closest Facility layer, adds location for facilities and incidents, solves the network, and export the closest routes to selected folder. this automation dynamically calcuates the nearest facility based on shortest distance and shortest time taken. The goal of this project is to streamline decision making for the nearest facility site selection and minimize manual intervention by leverging ArcGIS network analysis tools and python automation.
